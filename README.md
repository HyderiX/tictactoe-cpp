# Tic tac toe in C++!

### Table of contents
* [Information] (#information)
* [Setup] (#setup)

### Information
This is just a simple project that I made in order to learn the syntax of C++. I also wanted to learn how to write makefiles and how to link header files.

### Setup
To build from source, you will need:
* Git
* g++ (The makefile is for g++)

Then you can just clone this repository and then:
```cd <to the folder where you cloned the repository>
cd src
make
cd ../build
./tictactoe```
